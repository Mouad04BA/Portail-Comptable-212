Step 1: Assess Financial Situation
Conduct a thorough assessment of the company's financial situation to determine if bankruptcy is the appropriate solution.

Before initiating bankruptcy proceedings, it's essential to perform a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health. This involves:

Reviewing all financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow)
Analyzing debt structure and repayment capabilities
Evaluating potential for financial recovery
Consulting with financial advisors and legal counsel
This assessment will help determine whether bankruptcy is necessary or if alternative solutions might be viable, such as restructuring, debt negotiation, or merger opportunities.

Step 2: Select Appropriate Procedure
Determine the most suitable bankruptcy procedure based on the company's situation: safeguard procedure, judicial reorganization, or judicial liquidation.

Under Moroccan law, there are three main bankruptcy procedures:

Safeguard Procedure (Procédure de Sauvegarde): For companies that are not yet in payment default but facing difficulties that they cannot overcome alone. This preventive measure allows the business to continue operations while restructuring debt.
Judicial Reorganization (Redressement Judiciaire): For companies that are unable to pay their debts but whose situation is not irreversibly compromised. This procedure aims to enable the continuation of business activities, maintain employment, and settle liabilities.
Judicial Liquidation (Liquidation Judiciaire): For companies whose situation is irreversibly compromised. This procedure entails ceasing business activities and selling assets to pay creditors.
The choice between these procedures depends on the company's financial situation, viability prospects, and specific circumstances.

Step 3: File a Petition
Prepare and submit the bankruptcy petition to the Commercial Court in the company's jurisdiction.

Filing a bankruptcy petition requires careful preparation of specific documents:

Formal petition request signed by the legal representative or authorized agent
Certificate of registration in the Commercial Register (less than 3 months old)
Copy of company bylaws and amendments
Financial statements for the last three fiscal years
Statement of assets and liabilities
Cash flow statement for the last six months
List of creditors with amounts owed and payment due dates
List of employees with their positions and seniority
Inventory of company property and assets
Detailed explanation of the financial difficulties and their causes
The petition must be filed with the clerk of the Commercial Court in the jurisdiction where the company's headquarters is located. The filing fee must be paid at the time of submission.

Step 4: Court Examination
The Commercial Court examines the petition and decides whether to open bankruptcy proceedings.

After the petition is filed, the court examines it to determine if the company meets the legal criteria for bankruptcy proceedings:

The court will schedule an initial hearing, typically within 15 days of filing
During this hearing, the company's representative must appear before the judge to explain the financial situation
The judge may request additional information or documents to properly assess the case
The court will verify that the company is indeed in a state of cessation of payments or facing insurmountable difficulties
Based on this assessment, the court will decide whether to open bankruptcy proceedings and which procedure is appropriate
If the court opens proceedings, it will issue a judgment that specifies the type of procedure (safeguard, reorganization, or liquidation) and appoint the necessary officials to oversee the process.

Step 5: Appointment of Officials
The court appoints an insolvency judge, a trustee, and possibly a creditors' representative.

When bankruptcy proceedings are opened, the court appoints several officials to manage the process:

Insolvency Judge (Juge-Commissaire): Oversees the proceedings, ensures compliance with legal requirements, and resolves disputes that may arise during the process
Trustee (Syndic): Manages the company's operations during the proceedings, prepares an inventory of assets, verifies creditors' claims, and implements the recovery plan or liquidation
Creditors' Representative (Représentant des Créanciers): In larger cases, represents the interests of creditors throughout the proceedings
